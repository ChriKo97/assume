    "## 1. Introduction to Market Zone Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Zone Coupling** is a mechanism that enables different geographical zones within an electricity market to interact and trade energy seamlessly. In the ASSUME framework, implementing market zone coupling is straightforward: by properly defining the input data and configuration files, the framework automatically manages the interactions between zones, including transmission constraints and cross-zone trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to provide a deeper understanding of how market zone coupling operates within ASSUME. While the framework handles much of the complexity internally, we will explore the underlying processes, such as the calculation of transmission capacities and the market clearing optimization. This detailed walkthrough is designed to enhance your comprehension of the framework's capabilities and the dynamics of multi-zone electricity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Multiple Market Zones:** Segment the market into distinct zones based on geographical or operational criteria.\n",
    "- **Configure Transmission Lines:** Establish connections that allow energy flow between different market zones.\n",
    "- **Understand the Market Clearing Process:** Examine how the market clearing algorithm accounts for interactions and constraints across zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will not only know how to set up market zone coupling in ASSUME but also gain insights into the internal mechanisms that drive market interactions and price formations across different zones."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we successfully integrated our custom market zone coupling simulation with the ASSUME framework. By preparing the necessary input files and configuration, running the simulation, and analyzing the results, we demonstrated how transmission capacities influence market dynamics and clearing prices across different zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration:** ASSUME allows for straightforward integration of custom market models through well-defined input and configuration files.\n",
    "- **Accurate Simulation:** Properly setting up transmission constraints ensures realistic modeling of energy flows and price formations.\n",
    "- **Effective Analysis:** Utilizing visualization tools like Plotly and Matplotlib facilitates comprehensive analysis of simulation outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup serves as a foundation for more complex and scalable market simulations, enabling deeper insights into the interplay between supply, demand, and transmission infrastructure in multi-zone electricity markets.\n",
