    "**Market Zone Coupling** is a mechanism that enables different geographical zones within an electricity market to interact and trade energy seamlessly. By coupling market zones, we can simulate more realistic and complex market dynamics, considering factors like transmission constraints, regional demand and supply variations, and cross-zone trading.\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incidence Matrix:** Represents the transmission capacities between different market zones. Calculated by summing the capacities of transmission lines connecting each pair of zones. While this method is simplified, it provides a foundational understanding of how zones interact within the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Market Clearing:** Demonstrates the core principles of market clearing, including bid acceptance and power flow management between zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of Transmission Capacity:** The presence of transmission capacity allows for energy trading between zones, potentially reducing overall costs and balancing demand more effectively. Without transmission capacity, each zone must rely solely on its local generation, which may lead to higher costs if local generation is more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations and Future Work:** The current method of calculating the incidence matrix by summing line capacities is limited and does not capture the full complexity of real-world transmission networks. Future implementations will enhance this approach to include more detailed network modeling, accounting for factors like line impedance, reactive power flows, and dynamic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this guide, you have successfully set up a simplified multi-zone electricity market simulation, enabling a deeper understanding of market dynamics and the role of zone coupling in balancing supply and demand. You can now extend this setup to include more zones, varying transmission capacities, and diverse bidding strategies to explore a wide range of market scenarios.\n",
